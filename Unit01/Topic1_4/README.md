# 1.4 Compound Assignment Operators
## Compound Assignment Operators

(x)= for all, shorthand that combines assignment of a variable and the operator's function
1.Takes the value currently in the variable, 2. Executes the function of the operator, 3. Reassigns the new value to the variable

`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`

The output of the example in video 1 is 2


## Increment and Decrement Operator
`++` increases the variable number by 1
`--` decreases the variable number by 1

In the example, x ends up as 3 and y ends up as 6.


## Describe the behavior
In the first example, x is first assigned to 23. X is then is multiplied by 2 and becomes 46. Then is moduloed by 10 and x becomes 6 and is then printed.

In the second example, x is assigned to 23 and y is assigned to 17. x is then multiplied by 4, and then assigned to 92. Y is increased by 1 and changed to 18. X is then multiplied by 3, and since it's an integer is rounded down and assigned to 30. Y is subtracted by 9, and changed to 9. X is moduloed by y, and x becomes 3 and is then printed.
