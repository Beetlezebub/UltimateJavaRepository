# 2.1 Objects - Instances of Classes
## What are Objects and classes?
A Class defines how  to make an object with the same behavior and attributes
An Object is a specific entity, created by a class that can be manipulated with your programs
Objects are instances of classes with variables used to name them
Each object has behaviors and attributes that are defined by the class that was used to create it

Ex:
    Class: House Blueprint
    Attributes: Color & location, Behaviors: Change color (repaint it)
    Objects: Rob's House; Orange; Elm St.
             Sage's House; Green; Main St.
             Jill's House; Beige; Rocky Rd.
    All 3 houses were created with the same blueprint (Class), but each has it's own color and location.
    Objects are instances of classes

The Class allows you to change the color of houses. So if Rob's house changes to yellow, are the other houses affected?
    
No because each house is separate and keeps it's individual color

If Jack moved into Jill's house, it's Jack's house and Jill's house (2 variables referring to the same object)
If we make Jill's house orange, then Jack's house is also orange because they're the same object
