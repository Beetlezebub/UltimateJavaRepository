# 2.8 Wrapper Classes - Integer and Double
`Integer` is a wrapper class; `int` is a primitive data type
Every Integer value has 32 bits of space; highest and lowest value the same as double


`Double` is wrapper class like `Integer`; allows you to construct a new Double object that represents the specified double value and returns the value of the Double as a double (same with Integer i believe, but swap with appropriate terms)
Needed in order to build an array list
