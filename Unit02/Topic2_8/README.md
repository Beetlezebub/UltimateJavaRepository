# 2.8 Wrapper Classes - Integer and Double
`Integer` is a wrapper class; `int` is a primitive data type
Every Integer value has 32 bits of space; highest and lowest value the same as double


`Double` is wrapper class like `Integer`; allows you to construct a new Double object that represents the specified double value and returns the value of the Double as a double (same with Integer i believe, but swap with appropriate terms)
Needed in order to build an array list


Autoboxing converts primitive data types to their corresponding wrapper classes
Every primitive data type has a corresponding wrapper class type
Can unbox stuff and convert it back to a primitive data type

Primitive data types only store single values (Ex: 10, 22.5, true)
Reference types store only references (Ex: `String` `ArrayList`)
Wrapper classes are used to convert primitive types into reference types
In Java 5.0 autoboxing is accomplished without having to call a constructor of a corresponding wrapper class object

Autoboxing -- the automatic conversion that the Java compiler makes between primitive data types and their corresponding objkect wrapper class
Unboxing -- the automatic conversion the compiler makes from a wrapper class to primitive type
