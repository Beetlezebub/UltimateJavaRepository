# 2.6 String Objects - Concatenation, Literals, and More
Strings are immutable (can't change the state of the defined)


Concatenation is the joining of data (operators like `+` and `+=`)


Escape sequences allow special characters to be output and actions to be inserted; they always start with `\`
    `\"` -- prints double quote character
    `\\` -- Prints a backslash character
    `\n` -- inserts a new line
They trigger the escape so Java will perform/display/print the next command in the sequence
