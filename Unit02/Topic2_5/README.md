# 2.5 Calling a Non-void Method
## Paying for Lunch
In the scenario, the behaviors you would need your code to represent would be divifding the total amount of the bill into equal parts for everyone to pay
The info you would need to know is how many people there are and the total amount for the bill
The info you need to return would be the divided amount(s) to be paid


You can change printing a value into a returning a value instead, so you can then continue to use it further in your code
