# 3.7 - Comparing Objects
[come back and type out reference at start of first video]
There are 4 object references (variables) in the exxample, and 3 objects

`myHouse` and `annasHouse` refer to 2 separate objects with identical attributes
`myHouse` and `momsHouse` are aliases for the same `House` object
`bobsHouse` does not reference an object (because it's null)

[type out 2nd code example]
