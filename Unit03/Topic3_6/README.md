## De Morgan's laws in action
Given 2 Boolean variables (or Boolean expressions), `a` and `b`:
`!(a && b)` is equivalent to `(!a || !b)`
When you distribute the "not" to the expression, it flips the `&&` to `||`
The same is true for an `||` expression

We know for a Boolean variable `a`, `!(a)` is equivalent to `(!a)`; what about Boolean expressions
If you negate `(x > 0)`, it'd be equivalent to x is not greater than 0, which is just `(x <= 0)`
When distributing "not" with a Boolean expression it "flips" the relational operator to the opposit operator
    !(x > 0) equivalent to (x <= 0)

## Truth Tables
Truth Tables are tools to help evaluate and show equivalency in Boolean expressions
By testing all of the different combinations of the Boolean values, the truth table makes it easy to see al of the possible outcomes.
